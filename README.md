# NOMADS - Open Source MMORPG
This is an oldschool space exploration browser game.
The objective of the game is to explore and colonise multiple planets and solar systems, evolving your technologies, upgrading your military power and gathering knowledge in a virtually unlimited Universe.

Game functionality is being added on regular updates however the developer does not guarantee any time-frame for fully completion as the core game functions are being designed and integrated during the general coding.

This game is not yet designed for mobile devices.
A new template will be added exclusively for smartphones once the game is playable.
